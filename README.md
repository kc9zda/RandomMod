RandomMod aka RandomCrapMod

===

	This is a mod with a planned variety of
random items. Items currently implemented: (don't worry if there aren't many there)

* Exploding Snowball

	I do plan on more items in the future, but
I have not thought of any way to implement them yet,
there for they are not listed here.

	If you have a suggestion and wish to 
implement it, please create a Pull Request. If
you do not wish to implement the feature, then 
please open an issue with a title starting with:
"[FEATURE REQUEST]". Any issues for feature requests,
that do not follow this rule will be treated as 
near-lowest priority.
